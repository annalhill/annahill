# README.md for Web-Dev Project 3

## By Anna Hill

### 1. So far I've made minimal progress on my page except setting up the initial pages and attaching the initial stylesheets. In my case I chose to use two, one being my style and the other my layout. I did this no because it's necessary for this project but I wanted to see how I could get them to interact. Hopefully it goes well!

### 2. I've now started to add colors and fonts to my work and I am finding that a lot of the time when I try and use rgb values they don't work so I have resorted to using the color names or hex values. Despite that however, you'll find the colors listed differently across the board of my pages because I wanted to try some other styles and see if/ how they worked with my .html.

### 3. I've also added in the links and I am pretty happy wit the way the link clicks, hovers, etc turned out with the red accents to create a 'heart- style' (or lack there-of since his poetry is about broken hearts...) in my pages.

### 4. At the moment I am trying to add pictures to my pages so lets see how this goes...
