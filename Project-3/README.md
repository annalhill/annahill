# README.md for Web-Dev Project 3

## By Anna Hill

### 1. So far I've made minimal progress on my page except setting up the initial pages and attaching the initial stylesheets. In my case I chose to use two, one being my style and the other my layout. I did this no because it's necessary for this project but I wanted to see how I could get them to interact. Hopefully it goes well!
