    <h1> Whiskey, Words, and a Shovel </h1>
    <h2> A book of poetry by <i> R.H. Sin </i></h2>
    <p1>
      <q>I usually become a ghost to those who no </br>
        longer deserve my time. I've never seen a point </br>
          in explaining my absence to someone </br>
          who failed to appreciate my presence. You </br>
          don't owe any explanations to those who hurt you.</q>
    </p1>
    <p2> <q>Wide awake as your soul remains tired. </br>
      Sitting silently under the moon as your mind continues </br>
        to scream. you're losing yourself, you're </br>
        losing sleep but he's losing you. some time soon, the </br>
        thought of him will no longer keep you up at night.</q>
    </p2>
    <p3> <q>The best feeling is being able to miss</br>
       someone who actually makes an effort to make you </br>
        feel good, feel peace.</q>
    </p3>
