      <q>I usually become a ghost to those who no longer deserve my time. I've never seen a point </br>
          in explaining my absence to someone who failed to appreciate my presence. You </br>
          don't owe any explanations to those who hurt you.</q>
    </p>
    <p> <q>Wide awake as your soul remains tired. sitting silently under the moon as your mind continues </br>
        to scream. you're losing yourself, you're losing sleep but he's losing you. some time soon, the </br>
        thought of him will no longer keep you up at night.</q>
    </p>
    <p> <q>The best feeling is being able to miss someone who actually makes an effort to make you </br>
        feel good, feel peace.</q>
