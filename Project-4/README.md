# Project 4 Updates: Responsive Design

##I understand that I have started this assignment late however, I have been in a crunch to get work done in my other classes. but that certainly doesn't mean that I am ready to put this on the back-burner because i love coding (I am thankful that HTML is more straightforward than processing!)

## The first steps I am taking are getting the basic information onto the page and making sure it is aesthetically pleasing. So far this is going just fine. Later tonight however I plan on making the responsive design portion on this project and making my work compatible with other devices, sources, links, etc. Wish me luck!

## So in attempt to finish up this project I completed the alterations to make it compatible with other devices. So far it is working out which I am very proud of myself for! The only issue I am having in this is getting my image to show up correctly. It'll appear however the dimensions are very off, even in regular settings. I am wondering if this might have something to do with the quality or format of the screenshot I took. I might never know but will experiment with that aspect more once finals week is over.

## Thank you Justine for an amazing semester and teaching us so much! I have taken a liking to coding and web design through this class and interactive media and cannot wait to dive further into the world of coding!
