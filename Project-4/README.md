# Project 4 Updates: Responsive Design

##I understand that I have started this assignment late however, I have been in a crunch to get work done in my other classes. but that certainly doesn't mean that I am ready to put this on the back-burner because i love coding (I am thankful that HTML is more straightforward than processing!)

## Te first steps I am taking are getting the basic information onto the page and making sure it is aesthetically pleasing. So far this is going just fine. Later tonight however I plan on making the responsive design portion on this project and making my work compatible with other devices, sources, links, etc. Wish me luck!
