      <p2> Interactive Preformance Examples:
        </br>
        From the research I have completed, a good example of interactive prformance is the Experience Music Project in Seattle, WA.
        In this large crafted piece of art, the experience is designed and left up to the participant. Whether the participaant chooses to
        react to the music playing in the main hall or experiment with the sound deisign room where one or more people can play with
        instruments and record their own tracks is their personal choice. No mattyer what the decision, their participation will produce their
        outcome and make every participants experience within the interactive preformance exhibit different.
