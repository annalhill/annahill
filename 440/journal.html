    </br> 1. Random Access: The use of various inputs and outputs and being able to have control and manipulation over the content.
    </br> 2. Trigger and Output: Coordinated control of multiple media elements.
    </br> -> Inputs and outputs (aka mapping) -> many to many, many to one, one to one
    </br> 3. Media Manipulation: Manipulation and the relation of variables to "paint" a picture or experience. The participants ability to create change.
    </br> Preformance with constraints
    </br> Strengths of both live preformance and media -> the intangible relations of how live vs. personal tech experiences formulate different feelings or emotions towards a preformance or moment
    </br> A more meaningful intereractive preformance between the preformer and the audience.

<p1> <b> Interactivity and Liveness in Electraucoustic Concert Music by Mike Frengel </b>
</br> The concept and interaction of electrical facilitators and their ability to interect and control or react to live preformance.
</br> Agents: Live preformer, electronics, and spectators
</br> Attributes of live preformance:
<ul>
</br><li> <i> Virtuosity: </i> Outstanding preformance that is beyonf the norm. Mastery of motor and musical language. The control and combination
</br> of such mastery skills provide an enticing and perceptually overwelmign experience. </li>
</br><li> <i> Fallibility: </i> Mythos. The ability to fail and literally fall is a characteristic to liv preormance that makes it human and has the
</br> audience sitting on the edge of theri seat waiting to watch this obstacle being overcome. </li>
</br><li> <i> Spontaneous Variability: </i> The evolution and individual characteristics each artist/ preformer brings forth. </li>
</br><li> <i> The influence of visual cues: </i> Workign with music in particular, the ability to create a story and mimic the storyline or the music to create a
</br> succinct preformance. All of the above factors placed into a preformance, allow for the appeal of live preformance. The process produces
</br> a product whether that be a good or bas reaction. Overall, live preformance alone is visually, mentally and physically stimulating and when you add a factor
</br> in such as electronics, adds to the works complexity and also adds another stimulating factor in, "how'd- they- do- it?".</li>
</br><li> <i> Presence: </i> "physical copresence of preformers and audience; temporal simultaneity and reception; experience in the moment" (Frengel, 2) </li>
</br><li> "how'd- they- do- it?": A shift of atention towards function and allowing a spectator to see and inderstand the "human- machine interaction". </li>
</ul>
</p1>
</br>
<p1> Electroaucoustics:
</br>  Typically don't involve a live preformer on stage
</br>  What can be gained when sound sounrces and mechanics cannot be seen?
</br>  When preformers are involved, a lot of coordination has to take place as there is highly limited flexibility.
</br>  Electroaucoustic music tries to free the preformer from these constraints.
</p1>
</br>
</br>
<p1> The Instrumental Model:
</br> The use of an instrument to create a more organic process, product interaction. This provides a certain level of consistency
</br> as well to help develop, express, and react.

<p1> <b> Understanding Interactive Systems by Jon Drummond </b>
</br> Interactive defines a reactive system that includes an audience or participation in some manner.
</br>
<ol>  <i> Introduction </i>
</br> <li> Combining mediums and being able to work among similar rtists to creat new and exciting pieces. </li>
</br> <li> The ability to provide experiences for an assortment of audiences, musical and non- musical.</li>
</br> <li> Interactive music systems used in a variety of systems.</li>
</ol>
<ol>  <i> Definitions </i>
</br> <li> Traditional roles in interactive composition?</li>
</br> <li> Shared processes and products- human and machine interactions.</li>
</br> <li> Musical Output as a result of shared interactions.</li>

<p1> In class notes </p1>
</br> <p1> Genres are important because they give us a form of communication in a topic we can't quite evaluate on a normal scale.
</br> A reactive and interactive system that uses the agents of Preformance, Ausdeince and technology to create an experience or painting.
</br> Trying to effect state changes in another agent (at least two agent).
</p1>
</br> <p8> Dr. Musick's definintions:
<ul>
</br><li> Interactive: A system, with at least two agents, who have an equal oppurtunity of effecting state changes in every other agent.</li>
</br><li> Reactive: A one- way sharing of information, with the goal of changing something else. </li>
</br><li> Dynamical: </li>
</br><li> System: Some sort of organized group of things, that do something. </li>
</br><li> Liveness: The perception of whether something is actually occuring in real- time? (i.e. the email problem) </li>
</ul>
</p8>
<p1> </br> A tool vs. Instrument -- What is technology?
</br> What is a visual instrument?
</br>
</br>
<p8> Types of Systems:
</br> <ol> Interactive System Models:
</br> <li> The instrumental model: Reactive system, something that a preformer understands its possible outputs. </li>
</br> <li> The conductor model: Moderator of output information, typically includes fixed- media, controls timing, not at the micro- level of the instrument. </li>
</br> <li> The reflexive model: Starting to introduce true agency, responds to something at the input, may make it's own choices, however, still expected results. </li>
</br> <li> The virtual preformer model: working towards full agency. </li>
</ol> <i> System Design Terms </i>
</br> <li> Affordance: </li>
</br> <li> Constraints: </li>
</br> <li> Agency: </li>

An example of interactive prformance is the Experience Music Project in Seattle, WA.
In this large crafted piece of art, the experience is designed and left up to the participant. Whether the participaant chooses to
react to the music playing in the main hall or experiment with the sound deisign room where one or more people can play with
instruments and record their own tracks is their personal choice. No mattyer what the decision, their participation will produce their
outcome and make every participants experience within the interactive preformance exhibit different.

<p3> <b> Project 2 </b> </p3>
<p3> Sound Poetry:
</br> Launch: Wednesday, February 21st
</br> Sketch due: Wednesday, February 28th
</br> Project due: Wednesday, March 14th
</br> Documentation due: Monday, March 19th
</br> In this project, I will be building upon my sketch of taking in amplitude ratings from a microphone (stereo) and outputting it in the form of words. Depending on what
level of amplitude comes into the system, the sketch will "upload" a word and as you strat using different voices and sounds, the sketch will create a flw of words. SOmetimes
your poetry will make sense, and other times the words will come out in very random and unreadable manners.The main concept of this is that you'll be creating your own structure and as you figure out,
as the preformer, what sounds make certain words, you can structure your own protry or sentences.
</br> Agents/ Technology: Procesing Sketch, Microphone (could be from the computer or external- depends on resources), and preformers (myself or classmates).
